h1. Twitter Beanstalk WebSocket Example

Quick experiment of going from twitter to the browser, with no polling.

It goes something like this:

Twitter Stream -> Filter -> Beanstalk -> EventMachine -> WebSocket -> HTML5 Browser

h2. Requirements

* Ruby
* Beanstalk
* gem install bundler

h2. How To

# bundle install (first time, to install the dependencies)
# beanstalkd # start beanstalk
# ruby twitterfeed.rb twitter_username twitter_password # start the filter
# ruby socket.rb # on another shell

Then you can open client/index.html on a HTML5 WebSocket compatible browser (tested with Webkit nightly).

Read the code, and have fun! :)
